ADD PERCENTAGE TO SPECIALS - OPENCART EXTENSION
===============================================

Requirements - Opencart versions 1.5.x
			 - Correctly installed vQmod (freely available at www.vqmod.com)

This extension is written for default installations, but as no core files are overwritten it can be trialled on any site running vQmod with a very low risk of causing problems. If the extension does not work as expected, then simply remove the xml file from your vqmod/xml folder and clear the vqmod/vqcache folder to return to your previous installation.

As with every extension/modification, however, it is good practice to ensure you have a current backup of your files and folders BEFORE making any changes.
