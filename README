ADD PERCENTAGE TO SPECIALS - OPENCART EXTENSION
===============================================

Requirements - Opencart versions 1.5.x
			 - Correctly installed vQmod (freely available at www.vqmod.com)

This extension is written for default installations, but as no core files are overwritten it can be trialled on any site running vQmod with a very low risk of causing problems. If the extension does not work as expected, then simply remove the xml file from your vqmod/xml folder and clear the vqmod/vqcache folder to return to your previous installation.

As with every extension/modification, however, it is good practice to ensure you have a current backup of your files and folders BEFORE making any changes.


This extension is designed to be compatible for multi-language websites - and comes with English, French and Dutch languages pre-installed. There are some comments regarding adding new languages - but if you need assistance, or would like to support this project by increasing this range then please contact me with your new language versions and I can add them for the benefit of other users.
